In this paper we consider de
ation and augmentation techniques for accelerating the
convergence of Krylov subspace methods for the solution of nonsingular linear algebraic systems. The
two techniques are conceptually dierent from preconditioning. De
ation \removes" certain parts
from the operator, while augmentation adds a subspace to the Krylov subspace. Both approaches
have been used in a variety of methods and settings. For Krylov subspace methods that satisfy a
(Petrov-) Galerkin condition we show that augmentation can in general be achieved implicitly by
projecting the residuals appropriately and correcting the approximate solutions in a nal step. In
this context, we analyze known methods to de
ate CG, GMRes and MinRes. Our analysis reveals
that the recently proposed RMinRes method can break down. We show how such breakdowns can be
avoided by choosing a special initial guess, and we derive a breakdown-free de
ated MinRes method.
In numerical experiments we study the properties of dierent variants of MinRes analyzed in this
paper.
